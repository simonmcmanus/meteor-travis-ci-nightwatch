![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zeroasterisk/meteor-travis-ci-nightwatch.svg)

You can see a [successful build](https://travis-ci.org/zeroasterisk/meteor-travis-ci-nightwatch/builds/46157777)
and an intentional [failed build](https://travis-ci.org/zeroasterisk/meteor-travis-ci-nightwatch/builds/46158099)
in the Travis-CI history of this project.

Right now, we are only using selenium and firefox on travis-ci.

If you want to see how to implement this yourself, take a look at the [.travis.yml](./.travis.yml) file.

### Things to notice

* I have chosen to include the selenium stand-alone driver in my git repo,
  you may not want to so.
* I have chosen to explicitly state that tests happen on `http://localhost:3000/`

### TODO

* I am downloading and installing the full Meteor application on every commit,
  it might be worth trying to cache it.
* variation to do a `phantomjs` - which would be faster
* variation to do an API interface to use multiple browser profiles at once - which would be awesome
